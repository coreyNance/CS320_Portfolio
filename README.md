How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To try and ensure that the software, program, or code is secure is to test every angle of the code.  The developer needs to test for not just when the action does what its suppose to do but also when its going to go wrong.  Whatever the criteria is for a certain object whether its limiting the amount of characters allowed in a name or checking to make sure the information is entered has to be checked.  On example is having a users last name be empty or null. There has to be a test to make sure that the program does fail properly.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs become program requirments, which then becomes how the program acts.  The basic overview of this is first the users needs are addressed. Second, they are put into software requirements, and then theird, they are implenmented and tested within the program. 


How do I approach designing software?

I ususally like to break up each software requirement and then develop small portions of code to satify those requirements.  Then I look into all the different ways that they program could fail or not meet requirements and then develop tests so that passing and failing scenerios can be tested to make sure they are working as intended.
